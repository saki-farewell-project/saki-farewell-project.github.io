You are my motivation, my support and will always be someone I look up to, and think about. I decided on what to do in my life after watching, and listening to you, I got my courage from this little girl who strive to become someone so special, someone so strong and someone so dazzling. Thank you for everything, everything that you have done, thank you for you being Saki, thank you for becoming my「　」.

I will continue to support your singing activities. Thank you for your regular singing streams in recent months. Although I wasn't quite interactive on YouTube or Twitter, I really enjoyed the time. Until now, I'm still not accustomed to your absence at 20:00. Guess I can never get used to it. However, neither will I ever feel lonely having your ever-lasting spirit with me. You had always been straightforward and passionate, the same Saki since day one. And I'm sure you will always be. Take care and good luck! "
