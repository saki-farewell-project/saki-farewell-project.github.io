Until now, I'm still not accustomed to your absence at 20:00. Guess I can never get used to it. However, I will never feel lonely having your ever-lasting spirit with me. You had always been straightforward and passionate, the same Saki since day one. And I'm sure you will always be. Take care and good luck!"
