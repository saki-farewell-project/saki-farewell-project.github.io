Therefore, I am very confident about your future. I will continue to support your singing activities. Thank you for your regular singing streams in recent months. Although I wasn't quite interactive on YouTube or Twitter, I really had a great time watching your streams. Until now, I'm still not accustomed to your absence at 20:00. I guess I can never get used to it. However, I will never feel lonely having your ever-lasting spirit with me. You had always been straightforward and passionate, the same SAKI since day one. And I'm sure you will always be as well. Take care and good luck! "
